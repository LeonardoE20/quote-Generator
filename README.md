# Story
When I was a kid my mom would always wake up early to cook for my dad and I in the morning to start her day. She would then go to work, but one day she just felt very unmotivated. So now. as I got older and have the skills to create whatever I want I thought of this moment and wanted to create something that can help her get motivated in the morning when she is not feeling it. There are quotes online where she can find and help her through her day but what better way to find out her son created something similar that she can use. It would be more meaningful.
## Instructions
When you are in the webpage of the project all you need to do is click on the new quote button to generate a new quote. If you would like to post it on twitter I have created a button where it takes you to the app and tweet without copying and pasting.
